Ahmet </a></h1>
<h3 align="center">An enthusiastic Computer Science student from Sabanci University, Turkey </h3>

<h4> I am a junior Computer Science and Engineering Student who is an assertive Software Engineer candidate. From now on, I have worked on several areas and participated several projects: </h4>

- ðŸ”­ In my three years at Sabanci University, Iâ€™ve completed a great deal of coursework on fundementals of Computer Science and Engineering including advanced programming, data structures, algorithms, database systems, digital system design, and operating systems. 

- ðŸŒ± I spent my past semester focusing mostly on a full-cycle software enginering which I experienced a kind of agile development process. I finished 8 user-stories by both designing the frontend, database, and backend parts which I have used the mongodb, node.js, express.js, and react.js technologies. Additionally, I have worked on data visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning areas by participating 2 projects in that areas.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Software Bug Classification project which I focused on the classifation with the screen shots of codes by using the Convolutional Neural Network techniques. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a mobile application which provides a question-share portal within the university students.

<h3>REFMES</h3>

<p> Referee Management and Evaluation System which aims to solve one of the most significant problems of Turkish Football Federation which is referee assignments. With REFMES, observers(knowledgable people) and fans can give votes to the referees which later assigned for the more important matches. Including pre-mmatch voting, post-match voting and comments, observer voting, match importance algorithm with machine learning, many informative pages about referees and football clubs and league status, a multi functional interfaces for admin, REFMES is ready to serve TFF. </p>

<h3> Social Bot Detection and Political Tweet Classification</h3>

<p>By using several machine learning techniques, feature engineering on user and tweet metadata, this project enables to detect both users and political tweets with low mean square error. <\p>

<h3> Classifying Bugs From Screen Shots of Codes</h3>

<p>This research is based on the software bug detection by using Convolutional Neural Networks. Including the steps data extraction, creation, parse trees and coloring of parse trees, training with CNN.</p>
